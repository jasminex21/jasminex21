### Hello :)

Welcome to my GitHub! Thanks for stopping by!

I'm a current junior majoring in Statistics and Data Science and minoring in Computer Science at UT Austin. I enjoy programming in my free time and this is where I store my personal projects (usually based on my various interests). 

Currently an AI/ML intern at Lockheed Martin.

#### My interests include: 
- The English Premier League and Fantasy Premier League (but also sports in general)
- Music, musical analysis, and music-based games
- Bioinformatics / biostatistics
- Astrobiology / astronomy
- Machine learning and AI
- Linguistics, LLMs, and NLP
