### Hello :)

Welcome to my GitHub! Thanks for stopping by!

I'm a current sophomore majoring in Statistics and Data Science at UT Austin. I'm also aiming for a certificate in Computer Science. I enjoy coding in my free time and this is where I store my personal projects (usually based on my various interests). 

#### My interests include: 
- The English Premier League and Fantasy Premier League (but also sports in general)
- Cats
- Music (especially Taylor Swift) and musical analysis
- Bioinformatics / biostatistics
- Astrobiology
- Machine learning
