### Hello :)

Welcome to my GitHub! Thanks for stopping by☺️

I'm a college freshman majoring in Statistics and Data Science at UT Austin hoping to expand my coding abilities by doing personal projects centered around my various interests. I haven't gotten too far yet but I'm working on it!

#### My interests include: 
- European football (mainly the English Premier League)
- Cats
- Music (especially Taylor Swift)
